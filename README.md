# Movie Rating Prediction
## About
This is a data science project where I built a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, budget, cast, etc.
 Dataset
I used a movie dataset with columns such as:
- Title
- Genre
- Budget
- Revenue
- Cast
- Director
- IMDb Rating

## Goal
The main goal is to:
- Analyze the data
- Clean and preprocess it
- Build a machine learning model to predict ratings

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
## Results
I used regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest. The Random Forest model gave the best results.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Run the cells step by step

# Titanic Survival Prediction

## About
This project predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

## Dataset
I used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information like:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger class
- Fare
- Family members
- Survival status (target)

## Goal
The goal is to:
- Clean the data
- Explore patterns
- Train a model to predict survival

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
Logistic Regression and Random Forest gave good accuracy. Features like gender and class were important.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook
3. Run the code in order
